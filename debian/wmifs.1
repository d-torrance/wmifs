.TH WMIFS 1 "December 26, 2001" "wmifs"
       
.SH NAME
wmifs \- a dockable network traffic monitor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wmifs
[-d <display name>] [-i <interface name>] [-l] [-w] [-h] [-v]

.SH DESCRIPTION
WMiFS is a dockable applet for X11 that can monitor all your network
interfaces. It's designed for WindowMaker's Dock and AfterStep's Wharf,
but it's not dependant on these window managers and should work with
any other.
It can display the net load using a standard bar graph or using a waveform
mode. It also displays the state of the interface with a group of leds.
Clicking on the interface name will cycle to the next interface in the
system. Users can define commands to be executed when the different mouse
buttons are pressed on the main window.
