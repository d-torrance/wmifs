Description: WindowMaker dock app for monitoring network traffic
 wmifs is a dockable applet for X11 that can monitor all your network
 interfaces. It's designed for WindowMaker's Dock and AfterStep's Wharf,
 but it's not dependent on these window managers and should work with any
 other.
 .
 WMiFS stands for "Window Maker InterFace Statistics".
