wmifs (1.3b1-15) unstable; urgency=low

  * wmifs/wmifs.c: patch from Tom Marshall <tommy@home.tig-grr.com>, adds

wmifs (1.3b1-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/changelog: removed emacs stuff.
  * debian/conffiles: removed; DH_COMPAT=3 adds it for us.
  * debian/copyright: added upstream authors.
  * debian/rules: removed dh_make cruft.
  * debian/wmifs.1: documented Lock Mode.
  * wmifs/wmifs.c: the long interface name patch made wmifs segfault with
    some interfaces. Matyas Koszik <koszik@debijan.lonyay.edu.hu> spotted
    problem and mhp provided a nice patch with Matyas' fix (closes: #126501).
    This may fix #119181 too, but I can't check too well.

wmifs (1.3b1-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * wmifs/wmifs.c: patch from Davi Leal <davileal@terra.es> which fixes
    the display of long interface names. wmifs only has space to display
    interface names which are 5 characters long at the most. Now it will
    cut interface names so they fit well. For example, "dummy0" will be
    displayed as "dumm0", or "vmnet10" as "vmn10" (closes: #103083).

wmifs (1.3b1-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Standards-Version: 3.5.6.0 (no changes).

    Thanks, Patrick (closes: #105361).

wmifs (1.3b1-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * wmifs/wmifs.c: fixed a thinko in the previous patch. If you use
    LockMode without providing an interface, ignore the lock. Thanks
    again, Jorge.

 -- Jordi Mallach <jordi@debian.org>  Fri, 24 Jun 2001 23:24:29 +0200

wmifs (1.3b1-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Standards-Version: 3.5.5.0.
  * debian/wmifs.1: added a missing newline.
  * wmifs/wmifs.c: added a new command line argument, -l, which starts
    wmifs in "Lock Mode". With it, if you specify an interface with -i
    but it's not up, wmifs won't try to fall back to another existing
    interface. Thanks to Jorge Garc√≠a for the help. (closes: #26870)
  * And finally wmifs is bugfree(tm) (or you haven't reported them :)
